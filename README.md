# DataJoint Element for Functional Calcium Imaging

DataJoint Element for functional calcium imaging with support for
[ScanImage](https://docs.scanimage.org/), [Scanbox](https://scanbox.org/), [Nikon
NIS-Elements](https://www.microscope.healthcare.nikon.com/products/software/nis-elements),
and `Bruker Prairie View` acquisition software; and
[Suite2p](https://github.com/MouseLand/suite2p),
[CaImAn](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/CaImAn), and
[EXTRACT](https://github.com/schnitzer-lab/EXTRACT-public) analysis software. DataJoint
Elements collectively standardize and automate data collection and analysis for
neuroscience experiments. Each Element is a modular pipeline for data storage and
processing with corresponding database tables that can be combined with other Elements
to assemble a fully functional pipeline. This repository also provides a tutorial
environment and notebooks to learn the pipeline.
